* If planning on using Matlab (recommended), watch the tutorial videos 
  provided in the corresponding section, and perform “help images” in the
  Matlab command line for examples of important image related commands.
  
* Write a computer program capable of reducing the number of intensity
  levels in an image from 256 to 2, in integer powers of 2. The desired
  number of intensity levels needs to be a variable input to your program.
   
* Using any programming language you feel comfortable with (it is though
  recommended to use the provided free Matlab), load an image and then perform
  a simple spatial 3x3 average of image pixels. In other words, replace the value
  of every pixel by the average of the values in its 3x3 neighborhood. If the
  pixel is located at (0,0), this means averaging the values of the pixels at the
  positions (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), and (1,-1). 
  Be careful with pixels at the image boundaries. Repeat the process for a 10x10
  neighborhood and again for a 20x20 neighborhood. Observe what happens to the image 
  (we will discuss this in more details in the very near future, about week 3).
 
* Rotate the image by 45 and 90 degrees (Matlab provides simple command
  lines for doing this).
  
* For every 3×3 block of the image (without overlapping), replace all 
  corresponding 9 pixels by their average. This operation simulates reducing
  the image spatial resolution. Repeat this for 5×5 blocks and 7×7 blocks. 
  If you are using Matlab, investigate simple command lines to do this
  important operation.
