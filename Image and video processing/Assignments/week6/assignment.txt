* Use the level-sets method to implement constant motion. Consider simply 
  an image as the embedding function and deform it according to the
  corresponding equation, It=|∇I|. Implement also It=−|∇I|. Observe the
  result of both cases for different evolution intervals.

* Repeat the above exercise but now for each level set moving according to
  curvature motion.

* Repeat the above two exercises for a circular shape, meaning create the 
  initial embedding function to be a binary image with a certain value inside
  a disk and a different value outside of it.

* Implement the basic equation of the active contours and test it on some 
  images with simple objects. Initialize the evolving curve in different
  forms for more testing.
