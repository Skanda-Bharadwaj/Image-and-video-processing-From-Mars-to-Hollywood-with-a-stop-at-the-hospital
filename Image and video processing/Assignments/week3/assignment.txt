* Implement a histogram equalization function. If using Matlab, compare 
  your implementation with Matlab’s built-in function.

* Implement a median filter. Add different levels and types of noise to 
  an image and experiment with different sizes of support for the median 
  filter. As before, compare your implementation with Matlab’s.

* Implement the non-local means algorithm. Try different window sizes. 
  Add different levels of noise and see the influence of it in the need 
  for larger or smaller neighborhoods. (Such block operations are easy 
  when using Matlab, see for example the function at 
  http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/blockproc.html). Compare your 
  results with those available in IPOL as demonstrated in the video lectures.

* Consider an image and add to it random noise. Repeat this N times, for
  different values of N, and add the resulting images. What do you observe?

* Implement the basic color edge detector. What happens when the 
  3 channels are equal?

* Take a video and do frame-by-frame histogram equalization and run the 
  resulting video. Now consider a group of frames as a large image and do 
  histogram equalization for all of them at once. What looks better? See 
  this example on how to read and handle videos in Matlab:
  
      xyloObj = VideoReader('xylophone.mp4');

      nFrames = xyloObj.NumberOfFrames;
      vidHeight = xyloObj.Height;
      vidWidth = xyloObj.Width;

      % Preallocate movie structure.
      mov(1:nFrames) = struct('cdata', zeros(vidHeight, vidWidth, 3, 'uint8'), 'colormap', []);

      % Read one frame at a time.
      for k = 1 : nFrames
          im = read(xyloObj, k);

          % here we process the image im

          mov(k).cdata = im;
      end

      % Size a figure based on the video's width and height.
      hf = figure;
      set(hf, 'position', [150 150 vidWidth vidHeight])

      % Play back the movie once at the video's frame rate.
      movie(hf, mov, 1, xyloObj.FrameRate);


* Take a video and do frame-by-frame non-local means denoising. Repeat but 
  now using a group of frames as a large image. This allows you for example 
  to find more matching blocks (since you are searching across frames). 
  Compare the results. What happens if now you use 3D spatio-temporal blocks, 
  e.g., 5×5×3 blocks and consider the group of frames as a 3D image? Try 
  this and compare with previous results.

* Search for “camouflage artist liu bolin.” Do you think you can use the 
  tools you are learning to detect him?
