* Download and experiment with the sparse modeling free software packages 
  linked in the class website.

  - http://iie.fing.edu.uy/~nacho/cosmos/

* Compare the results of sparse modeling image denoising with those of 
  DCT-based image denoising as implemented in ipol.im

* Consider an image and select K patches from it as the dictionary; select
  those patches at random. With this dictionary perform sparse modeling
  image denoising and compare with the results obtained when learning the
  dictionary.

* Pick a particular example of sparse modeling image denoising and experiment 
  with different dictionary sizes. Plot the histogram of atoms usage, meaning
  the number of times each atom is used considering all image patches.
