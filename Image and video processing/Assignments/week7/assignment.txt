* Implement the basic non-local means type of inpainting approach. Do this 
  both for still and for video, where the search for similar patches in the 
  latter is across multiple frames.

* For a given image, compute at every pixel the inner product between the 
  gradient of the Laplacian and the level lines normal, this being the main 
  term in one of the inpainting techniques we learned. Display it and analyze 
  its behavior.

* For a given video, implement a very simple inpainting technique: At every 
  pixel to be filled-in, inpaint it with the median of the values (if available) 
  for pixels at the same spatial position corresponding to N frames before
  and N frames after, varying the value of N. Extend this to consider camera 
  motion, in particular by exploiting registration techniques as available 
  in Matlab and other packages.
